            <p>Although Stuart was born in Zimbawe, Africa, he lived most his life in the city of Surrey in BC. 
                In addition to Scuba Diving and Snow Boarding, he loves computers. This is why he joined the CST program
                at BCIT where he hopes to graduate with a Diploma in 2015. The area in Computing that Stuart is  
                most passionate about is software development. Needless to say, Stuart's favorite course is COMP1111.</p>
