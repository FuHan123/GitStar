            <p>Gurvir was born in Canada in 1995. He is interested in gaming, movies, spirituality, 
                food, computers, technology, science, Reddit, and various genres of music. BCIT was 
                his main choice for post-secondary education and he is very happy to have gained admission. 
                He really doesn't know what else to write so he is just typing random stuff as filler. I 
                don't know why you are still reading this. Go away.</p>
