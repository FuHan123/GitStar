            <p>Hello,
            Im coming to Bcit after having done a year at SFU. I realized that I wanted to do programming and Bcits practical program suited what I wanted to do. I hope to gain experience in terms of programming, but also experience in group projects. I'm very excited to start this year and look forward to working with all of you. My interests include all sorts of fitness hiking, and some video games on the side. I hope to have a career that will allow me to be sedentary so that I cannot be active outside of work.
