            <p>I was born in the mysterious land known as Nanaimo (not the skytrain station, on Vancouver Island). I am an avid gamer,
                varying from Nintendo to Xbox platforms and also getting into PC gaming. Other hobbies I have involve making dumb game videos for an unsuccessful Youtube channel
                (currently on hold as of right now), reading, and sleeping.  I wanted to go to BCIT as you can quickly gradulate as shows as proof
                that you're actually really good in the eyes of potential employers as BCIT is known for being notoriously tough.  </p>
