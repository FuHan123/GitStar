            <p>Kevin was born in Vancouver, BC and lived his whole life in this city. He is a big sports fan and loves playing sport
                related video games. He is also a big fan of computers and technology, which is why he joined the CST program at BCIT.
                Unfortunately, he isn't very good at programming and might be exploring other options after the end of first semester.
